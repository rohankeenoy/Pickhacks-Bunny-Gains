    <p>
      Welcome to the demo of Bunny Gains. Bunny Gains is set to be a game focused on financial well-being. A hungry rabbit must gather berries to make money. He can choose to invest in bread, which is sometimes worth more, or just sell them for cash in hopes that he will get a better price for bread later on. Moo-Money is a character that expects as many berries as possible and gives a bonus.
    
      <br> <br> <br>
      Financial well-being is crucial to teach at a young age, this game will exhibit the idea of risk/reward, cost/benefit, and introduces stock market concepts to all ages.

      How to Play
    </h2>
    <p> Right now, honestly, there isn't much to do. But check out the awesome animations using up,down,left,right or WASD !! Berries will spawn, but need to work on the collider,dialogue, and store still. We both have been wanting to make a game for a while so we hope to continue working on this after PICKHACKS!</p>
